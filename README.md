# RootLocus
Root locus plots are generated by a graphical method to examine how the roots of some system change with a system parameter. Generating them requires us to follow a 5 rule process/algorithm to plot the behavior of the system.

PS @Maya: any mention of PF in the code stands for Python Feature, just so we can use them in the final presentation
